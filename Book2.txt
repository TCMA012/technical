Five Lines of Code: How and when to refactor
Christian Clausen 
Coccinelle semantic patching project, an automated refactoring tool
Manning
Book
The book is split into two distinct parts; the first builds a foundation for how to talk about refactoring, why we do it, and lays out a practical set of rules for how to approach it. Unlike many other books that talk in broad terms this section provides example code and shows how to refactor it following the rules. You can follow along in the provided github repo and test your skills on a completely separate example.
The second part of the book broadens the scope and discusses broader topics relating to refactoring and software quality. My favorite topics related to how to use a compiler, comments in code, and premature optimization. All of these have allowed me to have good discussions with my work colleagues about what “good” code is and how we can improve the quality of the code we support.

Distributed Systems with Node.js: Building Enterprise-Ready Backend Services
Thomas Hunter II
conferences on Node.js and JavaScript, JSNSD/JSNAD certified, organizer of NodeSchool SF 
at least half of the code (and half of the book overall) really applies to any Node apps of any architecture (even a monolith). For example, the chapters on Observability (using Elasticsearch/ELK/etc.), Deployment (using Travis CI, Heroku, etc.) and Security are totally universal to any Node app.

Several other chapters are also not really about Node or distributed apps, per se, but focus on important external technologies in the wider ecosystem, and how Node can integrate with them (ex: Docker, Redis, HAProxy, PostgreSQL, etc...). This gets into both client libs in Node (with numerous code samples), but also a fair amount of general discussion about theory and architecture (what is a reverse proxy/cache server/data store, and how/why would you use it with your Node app? What are containers, and how do you build and run them in Docker CLI? What is Kubernetes, and how do you deploy your containers to it? etc...). All of that is good stuff, and well written, it's just not so much about Node itself.

For me the 2 most valuable chapters were:

Ch. #1) The author does a really good explanation of the Node internal V8 event loop, with minute details about _exactly_when_ the various different asynchronous events and built in functions fire and are handled (ex: setTimeout vs setInterval vs setImmediate, etc.)

Ch. #8) Resilience - This is the best chapter, which goes over a bunch of valuable tips/tricks/best practices that will help your Node apps either withstand runtime failures, or else fail gracefully and predictably. For me, this chapter alone was worth the cover price. It may have nothing new for really senior Node pros, but for mid-level devs it's great (and even you ninjas might learn a thing or two).

Help Your Boss Help You: Convert Conflict Into Opportunities
Ken Kousen
chapter 2, "Giving Good-Enough Answers", you're immediately given a "quick win" with a truly awesome technique, thoroughly discussed in 10 pages, that I had never thought of and makes perfect sense—when your manager sends you a question out of nowhere, disturbing your train of thought and disrupting the productive flow within which you find yourself, what do you do? It turns out that 
"good enough answers" (rather than hard won and time consuming perfect answers) are more than good enough. The author arrives at this insight via a thoroughly logical train of thought... and then presents you with 
a magic question that needs to be inserted at the end of the interaction in this context with your manager. It is an awesome and truly magical question and worth the price of the book itself.
